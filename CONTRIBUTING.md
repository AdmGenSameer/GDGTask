# Contributing to AutomateAI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AutomateAI as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code Style

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Components should be in PascalCase
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep components focused and reusable

### Backend (Node.js)
- Use Express.js patterns
- Follow CommonJS module system
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow RESTful API conventions

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We actively welcome your feature requests. Submit them as GitHub issues with the "feature request" label.
